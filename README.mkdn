---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using our trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/JDCTeam/manifests.git -b cr-11.0

or

    repo init --depth=1 -u git://github.com/JDCTeam/manifests.git -b cr-11.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
